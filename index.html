						<td class="ddd">A giant robot made in the King of Dreamland's image. Sporting a floating spherical body, left crank, right spiked mallet, missile launchers (not shown), and a large laser in its torso (hidden), the Dededestroyer Z is just one of many robo-Dededes of various designs.</td>

						<td><a href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Forgo_Dedede"><img class="img-fluid" src="dddfl.png" alt="forgottenland"></a></td>
						<td class="ddd">Falling into the Forgotten Land has turned this King Dedede to the wild side. Under the control and influence of the Beast Pack and Fecto Forgo, this king has traded mental for physical capabilities, now able to swing large stone pillars with ease, summon meteors on command, spread lava below his feet, and inhale much better than Kirby can.</td>
						<td>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</td>

					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://wikirby.com/wiki/Masked_Dedede"><img class="img-fluid" src="dddm.png" alt="maskeddedede"></a></td>
						<td class="ddd">Numerous battles with Kirby, all ending in loss, has driven King Dedede to the absolute max. Masked Dedede is his more powerful alter ego, wielding but a mask and a rocket hammer. His new hammer is able to spit fire and launch mini-missiles, and the rocket thruster lets him hammer spin much longer and much faster than normal. This King Dedede is not holding back.</td>
						<td>Kirby Super Star Ultra</td>

						<td><a href="https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/King_Dedede#Kirby_Star_Allies"><img class="img-fluid" src="dddsa.png" alt="machodedede"></a></td>
						<td class="ddd">Another instance of the king being possessed, the Jamba Heart has taken control of his mind and body. Under its influence, King Dedede gains an incredibly muscular top-half, giving him a great increase in both strength and agility, the former letting him crash through multiple floors in his boss fight and the latter letting him swing around pillars and hop across the stage.</td>
						<td>Kirby Star Allies</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><a href="https://kirby.fandom.com/wiki/Dedede_Clone"><img class="img-fluid" src="dddc.png" alt="dededeclone"></a></td>
						<td class="ddd">After gaining a DNA sample from King Dedede, the Haltmann Works Company has managed to clone him as slime-like beings. These Dedede Clones all have the same attacks, voice, look (almost), but not his soul. However, in the main fight against a clone, it is able to split itself into three upon defeat, all fighting simultaneously. After their defeat, the three Dedede Clones all man the D3 Cannon (not shown), able to fire lasers and flames.</td>
						<td>Kirby: Planet Robobot</td>
